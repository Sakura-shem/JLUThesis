    \par Environmental problems are becoming increasingly serious, 
    and energy-saving driving of vehicles has become the general trend. 
    With the continuous progress of intelligent vehicles, 
    they can perceive the information of their own vehicle and environment in the process of driving. 
    This paper takes intelligent vehicles as the research object and uses relevant algorithms of deep reinforcement learning to carry out energy-saving motion planning for vehicle driving. 
    The main progress of this paper comes down to the following three aspects: 
    \par Firstly, the virtual simulation scene of intelligent vehicle driving is built. 
    By analyzing the characteristics of deep reinforcement learning applied to vehicle motion decision control, a co-simulation platform is established by using the open source vehicle simulator Carla and Python environment, and the vehicle model and various sensors in Carla sensor are used to make the co-simulation environment become the training environment in reinforcement learning. It provides an experimental platform for verifying the validity of the algorithm in different scenarios.
